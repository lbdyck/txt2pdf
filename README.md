# TXT2PDF
Covert z/OS data to PDF

The TXT2PDF application is a tool that can be used to convert a text file
into an Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Doucment Format) file.
                                                                             
The input data set must be a sequential data set or a member of a partitioned
data set. The output will be a sequential data set or a member of a
partitioned data set and will be in PDF format.
 
The output data set must be transmitted or downloaded in binary to
a workstation capable or running an Adobe Acrobat Reader to view
the converted data.
