Usage:

    The only required parameters are IN and OUT.

    All parameters consist of a keyword followed by its argument.
    If the argument contains blanks, you must enclose the whole
    argument in double (") quotes.

    Aside from those where it makes sense, no arguments are case
    sensitive.  Filespecs and text values are notable exceptions.

    Some arguments accept multiple options and this is indicated
    using an elipse (...) in the parameter descriptions.

    Most numeric arguments can be specified with any number of
    decimal places.  Others like the column and row values must be
    specified as whole numbers.  This is not indicated below, so use
    common sense.  :-)

    Several parameters accept a filespec or colorspec.  These are
    described here:

    << FILESPEC >>

        Filespec syntax is determined by the system on which TXT2PDF
        is executing.  With the exception of TSO, TXT2PDF simply
        passes the spec to the system specific I/O routine.

        Under TSO, you may specify a partially or fully qualified
        dataset name.  A preallocated DD name may be specified by
        passing "DD:<name>" where "<name>" is the actual DD name.

    << COLORSPEC >>

        All colors can be specified using either the following
        names or you may specify the exact RGB values by using 6
        hexadecimal digits formatted as RRGGBB.

            Aqua     A     Black    Bla   Blue     Blu   Fuchsia  F
            Gray     Gra   Green    Gre   Lime     L     Maroon   M
            Navy     N     Olive    O     Purple   P     Red      R
            Silver   S     Teal     T     White    W     Yellow   Y

        Though intended for use with the barred paper style, the
        following colors may also be used:

            BlueBar        GrayBar        GreenBar
            OrangeBar      WhiteBar       YellowBar

Parameters:

    IN:
      <filespec>            Name of input file.

                            DEFAULT: none

    OUT:
      <filespec>            Name of output file

                            DEFAULT: none

    ANNOT:
     <type>                 Annotations are used to convey some sort
                            of information to the user.  Currently
                            defined types are:

                            Text T - Good old "sticky note"

                            DEFAULT: none

     TEXT:
      <page>                Specifies the page(s) upon which the
                            sticky note should be placed.  Defined
                            values are:

                            First F - Only on first page
                            Last  L - Only on last page
                            All   A - On all pages

                            DEFAULT: All

      <row>                 The row where the sticky note will be
                            placed.

                            DEFAULT: 1

      <col>                 The column where the sticky note will be
                            placed.

                            This is only an approximation since
                            TXT2PDF doesn't have access to the font
                            metrics.  Therefore, it assumes a fixed
                            pitch, 600dpi font for calculating the
                            column location.

                            DEFAULT: 1

      <state>               The initial display state of the sticky
                            note.  Defined values are:

                            Open   O - Sticky note is open
                            Closed C - Sticky note is closed

                            DEFAULT: Closed

      <text>                The text of the sticky note.

                            DEFAULT: none

    BG:
      <type>                A background will be drawn before the
                            text of the document and you may specify
                            as many backgrounds as you like.  They
                            will be placed in the order you specify.

                            Currently defined types are:

                            Stream   - PDF stream content
                            Textmark - Simulated "watermark"

                            DEFAULT: none

      STREAM:
        <filespec>          Name of file whose contents will be
                            embedded into a PDF XObject object.
                            This file can contain any PDF content
                            that is valid between the "stream" and
                            "endsream" keywords.  The graphic state
                            will be saved before the content and
                            restored after.

                            The stream content may use any of the
                            fonts supported by TXT2PDF.  Just use
                            the abbreviated name, e.g., CB for
                            Courier-Bold.

                            DEFAULT: none

      TEXTMARK:
      TMARK:
        <style>             A TEXTMARK is similar to a watermark.
                            The text will be drawn according to the
                            following styles:

                            TopDown  BU - upper left to bottom right
                            BottomUp TD - bottom left to upper right

                            DEFAULT: BottomUp

        <stroke colorspec>  The text will be drawn with this color
                            in an outline fashion.  If you do not
                            specify the fill colorspec, then the
                            text will appear hollow.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <fill colorspec>    Specifying a fill color will cause the
                            text to appear solid.  If you specify a
                            color different from the stroke color
                            you will get solid, outlined text.

                            DEFAULT: Gray (only if neither color
                                          is specified)

        <opacity percent>   Specifies the opaqueness of the test.
                            A value of 100 produces solid text and
                            a value of 0 produces transparent text.

                            DEFAULT: 100

        <font name>         Font defined via XFONT parameter or one of
                            the following builtin PDF font names:

        <text>              The text to draw.  A blank character is
                            added to each end of the text to keep
                            the tops and bottoms of the characters
                            from being clipped.  This happens due
                            to the rotation of the text.

                            DEFAULT: none

    BM:
      <bottom margin>       Offset in inches from bottom of page

                            messages issued by the program in a
                            Browse session.  In other environments,
                            the messages are simply typed to the
                            screen.  Valid values are:

                            Yes Y - Browse messages
                            No  N - Don't browse

                            DEFAULT: No

    CC:

    COMPRESS:
      <level>               The level of compression desired.  Specify
                            0 to turn compression off or 1 through 9
                            for fastest to best compression.

                            DEFAULT: 0

    CONFIG:
      <filespec>            Name of file containing additional
                            parameters.  Everything in this file
                            will be processed as if it had been
                            included as arguments immediately
                            following the CONFIG argument.  Any
                            arguments specified on the command line
                            after the CONFIG argument will override
                            those from the CONFIG file.

                            Full line comments are supported by
                            placing an asterisk in column 1.

                            To continue a line in the CONFIG file,
                            add a space followed by a hyphen to the
                            end of the line being continued.  Here's
                            an example:

                            line 1 contents that are cont -
                            inued on another line

                            DEFAULT: none

    CONFIRM:

                            Yes     Y - Issue standard messages
                            No      N - Be quiet
                            Verbose V - More messages

                            DEFAULT: Yes

    DEFCFG:
     <def. cfg filespec>    Name of a default config file as used by
                            the CONFIG parameter.  This only sets the
                            default name.

                            If a value is set and no command line
                            parameters are specifed, the file will be
                            treated as if it had been specified using
                            the CONFIG parameter.

                            You would usually use this in your local
                            TXT2PDFD EXEC if you want this ability.

                            DEFAULT: none

    DELIM:
     <character>            Allows you to change the delimiter used

     <doc. info filespec>   Name of file whose contents include
                            lines with a one name and value pair per
                            line.  The pairs will be added to the
                            Document Information dictionary within
                            the PDF file.  You may include any name,
                            but the standard PDF names directly
                            supported by TXT2PDF are:

                            DEFAULT: none

                            NOTE:  To provide the most flexibility, all
                                   coordinates and sizes are specified
                                   in user space units which are 1/72 of
                                   an inch.

                                   The origin is the lower left corner
                                   of the page and margins are ignored.

      LINE:

                            DEFAULT: none

        <opacity percent>   Specifies the opaqueness of the line.
                            A value of 100 produces an opaque line and
                            a value of 0 produces a transparent line.

                            DEFAULT: 100

        <colorspec>         The line will be drawn with this color.

                            DEFAULT: Black

        <thickness>         The thickness of the line.  Note that 0 is
                            a valid thickness and produces (in Acrobat
                            anyway) a very thin line.

                            The following types are available:

                            BUTT   - Square, no projection past end
                            ROUND  - Round, projection past end
                            SQUARE - Square, projection past end

                            DEFAULT: BUTT

        <dot on>            These 2 values work together to create lines
        <dot off>           with different dash patterns.  Used with the
                            ROUND cap style, you can also achieve dotted
                            lines.

                            The "dot on" value specifies the number of
                            units dashes within the pattern will be.  If
                            you do not specify "dot on", then a value of
                            0 will be used.

                            The "dot off" value specifies the number of
                            units the gap between dashes will be.  If
                            you do not specify a "dot off" value, it
                            will default to the "dot on" value.  This
                            produces an even "dash/gap" pattern.

                            If neither value is specifed, a solid line
                            will be produced.

                            DEFAULT: none (solid line)

      RECT:
        <x>                 The lower left x-axis cooridinate.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <y>                 The lower left y-axis cooridinate.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <width>             The width of the rectangle.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <height>            The height of the rectangle.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <opacity percent>   Specifies the opaqueness of the rectangle.
                            A value of 100 produces an opaque line and
                            a value of 0 produces a transparent line.

                            DEFAULT: 100

        <stroke colorspec>  The rectangle will be drawn with this color
                            in an outline fashion.  If you do not
                            specify the fill colorspec, then the
                            rectangle will appear hollow.

                            DEFAULT: Black

        <fill colorspec>    Specifying a fill color will cause the
                            rectangle to appear solid.  If you specify a
                            color different from the stroke color
                            you will get a solid, outlined rectangle.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <thickness>         The thickness of the line surrounding the
                            rectangle.

                            DEFAULT: 0

        <join style>        The shape used for the corners of the
                            rectangle.

                            The following types are available:

                            MITER  - Pointed
                            ROUND  - Rounded
                            BEVEL  - Chopped

                            DEFAULT: MITER

        <dot on>            These 2 values work together to create lines
        <dot off>           with different dash patterns.

                            The "dot on" value specifies the number of
                            units dashes within the pattern will be.  If
                            you do not specify "dot on", then a value of
                            0 will be used.

                            The "dot off" value specifies the number of
                            units the gap between dashes will be.  If
                            you do not specify a "dot off" value, it
                            will default to the "dot on" value.  This
                            produces an even "dash/gap" pattern.

                            If neither value is specifed, a solid line
                            will be produced.

        <font size>         Set the size of the font in points.

                            DEFAULT: 9

        <opacity percent>   Specifies the opaqueness of the text.  A
                            value of 100 produces opaque text and
                            a value of 0 produces transparent text.

                            DEFAULT: 100

        <stroke colorspec>  The text will be drawn with this color in an
                            outline fashion.  If you do not specify the
                            fill colorspec, then the text will appear
                            hollow.

                            DEFAULT: Black

        <fill colorspec>    Specifying a fill color will cause the
                            text to appear solid.  If you specify a
                            color different from the stroke color
                            you will get solid, outlined text.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <thickness>         The thickness of the line surrounding the
                            text.

                            DEFAULT: 0

        <join style>        The shape used for the corners of the
                            glyphs.

                            The following types are available:

                            MITER  - Pointed
                            ROUND  - Rounded
                            BEVEL  - Chopped

                            DEFAULT: MITER

        <rotation>          Specifies the rotation of the text.  The
                            value is given in degrees.  Negative values
                            rotate the image clockwise.

                            DEFAULT: 0

        <zoom>              Zoom factor in percent of original font
                            size.  Specifying a percentage less than
                            100 will cause the font to shrink and a
                            percentage greater than 100 will cause
                            the font to enlarge.

                            DEFAULT: 100%

        <text>              The text to draw.

                            The value may contain certain format
                            sequences that get replaced with different
                            values.  These sequences fall into 2
                            categories, date/time and dynamic.

                            Date and time sequences can be used in
                            both TEXT and STRING types.  The date and
                            time used is that at time of parsing.

                            The sequences start with a percent (%) and
                            are followed by one of:

                            % - literal percent
                            a - abbreviated weekday name
                            A - full weekday name
                            b - abbreviated month name
                            B - full month name
                            c - format: Sun Oct 26 02:00:00 2003
                            d - 2 digit day of month (zero padded)
                            e - 2 digit day of month (space padded)
                            H - 2 digit (24) hour
                            I - 2 digit (12) hour
                            j - 3 digit day of year
                            m - 2 digit month of year
                            M - 2 digit minute
                            p - meridian
                            S - 2 digit second
                            w - 1 digit day of the week (0=Sunday)
                            x - date format: 10/26/03
                            X - time format: 02:00:00
                            y - 2 digit year
                            Y - 4 digit year

                            Dynamic sequences can only be used with
                            the STRING type.  The values for these
                            sequences change during processing.

                            The sequences start with an at sign (@)
                            and are followed by one of:

                            @ - literal at sign
                            p - PDF page number (1 based)

                            DEFAULT: none

    ENCODING:
                            The ENCODING parameter is used to define a
                            character set encoding and is an alternative
                            to using the translation tables.

      <func>                The function to perform.

                            Functions are:

                            Define - Define a new encoding

                            DEFAULT: None

      DEFINE:
                            Defines an encoding, assigning a name and
                            filespec.

        <name>              The name to assign to the encoding.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <filespec>          Name of the file containing the UCM format
                            encoding.

                            DEFAULT: none

    ENCRYPT:
      <type>                The type of security to use for encryption.
                            Only the PDF standard security is currently
                            supported.

                            Currently defined types are:

                            Standard ST - Standard PDF security

                            DEFAULT: Standard

      STANDARD:
        <Owner password>    The password you wish to use to control
                            full access to the document.  Having
                            owner access gives complete control.

                            Per the PDF spec, only the first 32
                            characters are used.

                            The default is not to assign an owner
                            password which gives full control to
                            anyone with user access.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <User password>     This password gives users access to the
                            document according to permissions you
                            specify (or let default).

                            Per the PDF spec, only the first 32
                            characters are used.

                            The default is not to assign a user
                            password which gives a user almost
                            all permissions.  It does not allow
                            to change the security settings if
                            an owner password has been assigned.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <key length>        The key length controls the level of
                            encryption desired.  The only supported
                            levels are:

                            40  - 40-bit (Acrobat v4 and below)
                            128 - 128-bit (Acrobat v5 and above)

                            DEFAULT: 40

        <permissions/...>   By default, all permissions ara allowed,
                            You use as many of the following options
                            separated by the "/" characters as is
                            needed to remove the indicated permission.

                            The following are currently defined with a
                            brief description of each.  (The PDF spec
                            dedicates an entire page describing these,
                            so this is by far not complete.)

                            be used to split the selected outline
                            text into one or more segments.  Each
                            segment will becomes a node in the tree.

                            tree.  Selecting the leaf nodes will
                            reposition the display to the location
                            that index was found in the document.

                            There are several scan types that you can
                            use to generate the outline.  They are:

                            The RowCol type is equivalent to the
                            original indexing scheme that was
                            specified with the IDX parameter.

        <row>               The row where the text is located or 0
                            which means any line of the page.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <col>               The column where the text starts.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <len>               The length of the text.

      SCANROW:
        <row>               The row that will be scanned for
                            a match to the "text" argument.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <data col>          The column where the data starts.  This
                            may be a specified as an absolute column
                            within the selected row or as being
                            relative to the start of the located
                            text.  You specify a relative location
                            by prefixing the "data col" argument
                            with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.

                            a match to the "text" argument.

                            DEFAULT: none

        <data col>          The column where the data starts.  While
                            this may be a relative column location
                            as described under ScanRow, it doesn't
                            make much sense the scan column is known
                            ahead of time.

                            This should really be a "data row"
                            argument, but the scanning routine does
                            not have access to all rows at once.

                            within the selected row or as being
                            relative to the start of the located
                            text.  You specify a relative location
                            by prefixing the "data col" argument
                            with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.

    PAGE:
     <mode>                 Sets the recommended display mode.  This
                            is only a recommendation as the viewer
                            application may choose otherwise.
                            Currently defined values are:

                            None    N - Don't display thumbnails or
                                        outline
                            Outline O - Display the document outline

                            different than the "None" option since
                            the "None" option could override what
                            the user currently has selected.

                            However, if you are creating an outline
                            then the default will be "Outline".  If
                            that isn't desired, use this option to
                            override it.

                            DEFAULT: (let viewer app decide)

                            Again, these are only recommendations
                            and the viewer may simply ignore them.

                            Specify as many of the following flags
                            as you like, separated with the "/"
                            character:

      <type>                Allows you to use fonts other than the
                            14 standard Adobe fonts.  Please read the
                            the documentation for this keyword since
                            its use is fairly complex.

                            External E - External font "program"

                            Note that this does not embed the real
                            font.  It simply allows you to reference
                            a preinstalled one.

        <name>              The name to give the font so it may be

                            embedded into the PDF file as a font.
                            This file must contain valid syntax
                            for a PDF font object.

      INTERNAL:
                            Allows you to control handling of the
                            14 standard fonts.

        <name>              The name to give the font so it may be

        <fontspec>          The name of the builtin font to associate
                            with this name.

                            !!!IMPORTANT!!!

                            Many TrueType fonts are copyrighted and
                            may not be legally embedded, so make sure
                            you do your homework.

                            On z/VM and z/OS, the fonts can reside in
                            variable or fixed record data sets of any
                            record length and may reside in a PDS.

        <name>              The name to give the font so it may be

                            DEFAULT: WinAnsiEncoding

        <flag>              Allows control how fonts are embedded.  The
                            default is to embed and subset fonts:  You
                            may specify:

                            NoSubset    NS
                            NoEmbed     NE

        <filespec>          Name of the TrueType file.

                            DEFAULT: none

     <execname>             Allows you to specify a translation table
                            EXEC name other than the default TXT2PDFX.
                            (You may have input text in different
                            codepages.)

                            The execname specifies a standard REXX
                            EXEC that you can model after TXT2PDFX or
                            one of the XLATEnnn samples.
