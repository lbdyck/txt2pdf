History:

    12/02/09 - LBD - Updates from Mario Robitaille to resolve an
    (09.336)         issue when using Draw_String

    05/27/09 - PG  - Updates from Paul Gilmartin to correctly work under
                     OMVS.
                   - Add member OMVSIVP for verification under OMVS


    04/20/09 - LBD - The Truetype fonts are included in the font pds:
                         VERAMOBD
                         VERAMOBI
                         VERAMOIT
                         VERAMONO

    04/17/09 - LLL - Added TrueType font embedding and subsetting.  The
                       XFONT keyword was updated to specify the fonts.
                     Added the DELIM keyword to allow using characters
                       other the "/" as the parameter separator.
                     Added the ENCODING keyword to provide support for
                       Unicode.
                     Added new font name parameter to the TMARK type
                       of the BG keyword.
                     Added ROWCOL subtype to the ATTR type of the TEXT
                       keyword.
                     Object lengths are no longer forward references to
                       separate objects, somewhat reducing PDF size.
                     Fixed control character initialization so that it
                       they are translated properly.
                     Made sure all SELECTs had an OTHERWISE to make the
                       REXX compiler happier.
                     More minor cleanup.

    11/31/08 - LLL - Changed license to GPLv2 from QPL.  There were
                     companies wanting to distribute TXT2PDF with their
                     product and the QPL was too restrictive.

                     Even though the GPL allows it, I hope the companies
                     do not try to make money off of TXT2PDF since I
                     was kind enough to make it easier to redistribute.
                     May a pox be on them if they do.  :-)

    11/06/08 - LLL - Added support for ooRexx (based on Lionel's code)
                     Limit parameter precision in image positioning
                       since Acrobat Reader 9 can't deal with more than
                       20 digits to the right of the decimal.
                     Fixed Regina/Uni-rexx stdin/stdout handling.
                     Converted message table to stem for easier
                       compiling. (Joe Smidel)
                     Conversion table usage was reversed.
                     Added COMPRESS to TXT2PDFD.
                     Minor cosmetic clean up here and there.

    06/09/05 - LLL - Completely redid the carriage control handling
                     to correct the botched job I did with machine
                     CCs.  I believe it's finally right, but WATCH OUT!

    03/17/04 - LLL - Fixed stdin/stdout I/O for Regina and Uni-rexx.
                     Added 1, 4, 8, and 24 bit UNCOMPRESSED BMP image
                       file support.
                     Added new TILE action to the IMAGE parameter.

    03/03/04 - LLL - Added OMVS support. (Larry)

    02/16/04 - LLL - Further suggestions from Hartmut to allow easier
                     use of TXT2PDF on "non-English" systems.

                     While this change was "minor" in complexity, it
                     did involve some global (hahaha) changes.  So, you
                     might want to do a little extra testing before
                     using in production.

                     Those changes were to replace all "\" characters
                     and make locating "|" characters easier.

    02/14/04 - LLL - Contribution from Lionel to base CC on RECFM under
                       TSO instead of forcing to NO.  This is the way
                       it SHOULD have been all along, so it's my fault
                       for the behavior change.

                     NOTE:  Since this changes prior behavior, make
                            CERTAIN you check your jobs to verify that
                            either you have specified CC or you are
                            okay with allowing TXT2PDF to decide for
                            you.

                     Added 2 arguments to the IMAGE DRAW paramenter that
                       allow you to specify the page number and interval
                       at which the image should be drawn. (Perry)
                     Added automatic page sizing based on the largest
                       IMAGE printed on the page. (Perry)
                     Added (unverified) Turkish cset support. (Ibrahim)
                     Changed the way barred and holed paper is drawn.
                       Acrobat's TABLE SELECTION TOOL doesn't work when
                       a PDF contains Form XObjects.  (Well that's what
                       I "think" the reason is.)  'Sides, the new way
                       produces smaller PDFs.  (Len)
                     Large images brought out a bug that's probably
                       been there since the 03/01/2002 update.
                       (Thanks to Perry for reporting this one!)
                     Added DEFCFG parameter to allow specification of
                       a default CONFIG file name.  This would be used
                       in your local TXT2PDFD EXEC. (Perry)
                     Added XLATE parameter to allow you to change the
                       translation tables at runtime.  This allows
                       you to override any tables set with the TXT2PDFX
                       EXEC. (Hartmut)
                     Added TEXT parameter for changing the appearance
                       of the input text. (Charles)
    10/26/03 - LLL - Fixed missing font error when using DRAW TEXT and
                       no background
                     Replace CMS file instead of appending (Frank)
                     Added MAG keyword for setting initial level (Len)
                     Added STRING type to DRAW keyword (Len)
                     Added ability to specify date/time formats in
                       TEXT type of DRAW keyword (Len)
                     Couple of minor comment and variable cleanups
    10/09/03 - LLL - Modified to support COMPRESS on the CMS platform
                     (Real credit goes to Frank!  He did all the work.)

                                 T2PMAC  MACLIB (support above)
    08/12/03 - LLL - Fixed Textmark (keyed GB instead of BG...GRRR!!!)
                     Added TEXT type to the new DRAW keyword.
                     OS/390 files name can be mixed case now (old bug!)
    08/10/03 - LLL - Fixed $(stem.) processing in Issue() (extra line)
                     Cleaned up use of quotes and aposts
                     Added DRAW keyword for drawing rectangles and lines
                     Added IMAGE keyword to support use of JPEG images
                     IN and OUT are now optional on platforms that have
                       stdin and stdout
                     Messages are written to stderr on platforms that
                       have it
                     Can now run as a PIPELINE stage under CMS
                     When running as a PIPE stage, messages are issued
                       using the MESSAGE subcommand
                     Minor cosmetic changes (comments, blank lines, ...)
    08/06/03 - LLL - Fixed loop when reading files under CMS
                     Added UNPACK stage to file input under CMS

    05/05/03 - LLL - Added MAXOSIZE keyword and ability to limit size
                     of output files. (Joe Bruns)
                     Added RECALL to LISTDSI when allocating output DSN
                     to prevent an allocation error.
    04/25/03 - LLL - Reworked write routine to handle large page sizes

                     file is empty. (Len Steele)
    12/02/02 - LLL - Fixed the TEXTMARK background type.  It now figures
                     dimensions and offsets correctly for all page sizes
                     above the font size chosen.
                     Added TMARK background type.  It's the same as the
                     TEXTMARK type, but allows the font size to be
                     specified.  (Sorry, still can't change the font.)

                       (Thanks to Mitko's request and testing)
                     Added ability to change message level
                     Externalized the internal translation table to
                       allow correct translation of internal program
                       text.  (Wow!  Did that make sense.  :-))
                     Suppressed initial page break for '89'x machine
                       carriage control character.  (What is the right
                       way to do machine CC?!?!?!)

                       routine not found
                     Some minor cleanup (indents and comments)

                     Reread the manual about machine CC and removed
                     the printing of the line for immediate commands.
                     (Let me know if I'm too dense to get it...)

    07/06/02 - LLL - Wow!  Found a bug that has existed since before
                     this became a part XMITIP.  Acrobat didn't have a
                     problem with it, but the pdfinfo ute in the Xpdf
                     package pointed it out.  Checked the spec and,
                     sure enough, it was a bug.  What was it?

                     There was an extra blank at the end of the first
                     entry in the "xref" table.  (Oh, the shame!!!)

    07/05/02 - LLL - Added VONLY option

                     Added HTML colorspec capability
                     Routed IDX function through OUTLINE option
                     Changed all "<>" to "\="...why?  Felt like it. ;-)
                     Moved and updated the usage information
                     Cleaned up a few variable names

                     (PAGE and TEXTMARK additions prompted
                       by discussions with Len Steele.)

                     (OUTLINE option inspired by Neal
                       Gooch's multiple level indexing.)
