Installation instructions for TXT2PDF

Note: If you are going to use this package with the XMITIP package it is
strongly suggested that you place the TXT2PDF elements into the
appropriate libraries that are used by XMITIP (including for the IVP
step). To do this use the RECEIVEX exec in this library.

1. Unzip the provided distribution zip file
2. Upload the txt2pdf.xmit file into a sequential dataset
   with RECFM=FB,LRECL=80 using a BINARY transfer
3. Issue TSO RECEIVE INDS(upload.dsn) to create this installation pds
4. Read the $DOC Member
5. Execute the RECEIVE or the RECEIVEX member of the installation PDS
   to create the Panel and Load libraries
6. Edit member IVPJOB and run to validate
   - point to the load library created in step 5
   - point the rexx library to the installation pds
   - run the IVPJOB
   - download the generated PDF files and validate
7. Copy the Load modules into a library in your Linklist, Steplib, or LPALIB
   - alternately you can edit members T2P* and submit to reassemble and
     link the modules from the Assembler library
8. Copy REXX Program TXT2PDF in this dataset into a library in your SYSEXEC
   or SYSPROC concatenation.
9. Copy REXX Program TXT2PDFX in this dataset into a library in your SYSEXEC
   or SYSPROC concatenation if you desire an external translation table.
10. If you need to create a national language translation table then take
    a look at the PDFXLIB exec in the installation pds.
11. Copy REXX Program TXT2PDFD in this dataset into a library in your SYSEXEC
   or SYSPROC concatenation if you wish to set a default configuration.

The ISPF Interface will require the following steps:
1. Copy REXX Program TXT2PDFI in this dataset into a library in your SYSEXEC
   or SYSPROC concatenation.
2. Copy the ISPF Panels library into a dataset in your ISPPLIB concatenation
